  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>
    We provide an online platform that enables individuals and organizations to
    run voting, ticketing, and nomination events. We ensure confidentiality in
    online voting, ticket purchases, and the nomination process.
  </p>
  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    By agreeing to these Terms, you are also agreeing to our Privacy Policy,
    which can be found here.
  </p>
  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>
    Users of our platform are “Owners,” “Event Organizers,” and/or
    “Participants.” “Owners” are the individuals or entities who create the
    voting setup. Event Organizers are individuals or organizations who use our
    services. Participants are those who vote by casting ballots (“Ballots”).
    Participants cast votes via Mobile Money, Visa/Mastercard, or PayPal. Owners
    and Event Organizers must sign a Service Agreement for an account/setup.
  </p>
  <h2>License</h2>
  <p>
    Subject to these Terms, you are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
    limited license to access and use our platform as a service, as agreed and
    signed by both parties in a separate Service Agreement.
  </p>
  <h2>Payments, Cancellation, and Refund Policy</h2>
  <p>
    Payment processing services are provided by Paystack (https://paystack.com)
    in Ghana, and their terms and conditions apply to payments you make using
    them. Any personal information you provide to these payment providers will
    be processed in accordance with their privacy policies.
  </p>
  <h3>Cancellation</h3>
  <p>
    Fraudulent transactions are immediately canceled upon detection by our
    payment processing company. To protect Countmyvote and its clients against
    chargeback-related issues, any active sale associated with the same
    fraudulent credit card will also be canceled.
  </p>
  <p>
    You should be aware that receipt of payment does not necessarily mean these
    transactions cannot be reversed. We (our payment processing company) reserve
    the right to reverse a payment if the payer or the payer’s bank or payment
    service provider has charged back or otherwise reversed a payment. You will
    need to provide a valid receipt to help us contest the chargeback, and you
    will be notified promptly before such action takes place.
  </p>
  <h3>Refunds</h3>
  <p>Subject to applicable law:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      All transactions done on Countmyvote are final, and any requests for
      refunds are subject to review.
    </li>
    <li>
      Countmyvote will not be liable for any damages resulting from a wrong
      transaction.
    </li>
    <li>
      Countmyvote may pass on any costs incurred for conducting a refund to
      event organizers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Where required by law, refunds associated with certain transactions may be
      eligible for different treatment.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Right to Refund</h3>
  <p>
    You, the customer, are entitled to request a refund if the service paid for
    is not received/delivered by Countmyvote. If you want a refund, you must
    email us at countmyvote@gmail.com, call, or deliver your written request to
    Countmyvote at our registered office.
  </p>
  <p>
    All refund requests will be prioritized, and once reviewed and approved,
    will be returned to the original source of payment (e.g., Mobile Money
    account, or bank card).
  </p>
  <p>
    Countmyvote keeps detailed logs of all transactions. We will conduct a
    detailed investigation of all refund requests. If possible, we will process
    a return of the services already paid for.
